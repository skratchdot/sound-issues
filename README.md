# Circle Of Fifths Sound Issues

https://gitlab.com/c_hengst/sound-issues

> Sound glitches and artifacts appear randomly while playing back sounds. iOS is the worst, Safari on MacOS is distorting the sound and chrome sometimes has glitches too.
>
> Have a look at the video files to see (and hear) what the issue is...
>
> Please let me know if you have any idea how to solve this!
>
> This app uses vue.js as base and tone.js to handle sounds.

_NOTE:_ To help troubleshoot, I moved to a simplified: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/)
